# Rock Paper Scissor — Simple JavaScript Project

Overview

- Minimal browser game for teaching basic DOM selection, event handling, simple game logic, and updating the page.
- Intended as a short demonstration that students can read, run, and modify.

How to run

1. Create a file named `index.html`.
2. Copy the project HTML/JavaScript code into that file and save.
3. Open the saved `index.html` file in a web browser.
4. Click one of the three buttons (Rock, Paper, Scissor) to play a round.

Key pieces to review in the code

- Button selection and event listeners: how the script finds buttons with `data-choice` and attaches click handlers.
- Available moves and random selection: the `choices` array and use of a random index to pick the computer move.
- Comparison function: the conditional logic that determines win, lose, or draw.
- DOM updates: where and how the script writes the user choice, computer choice, and result into page elements.
